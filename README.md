# Stock-Prediction-and-Time-Series

Multiple projects making use of LSTM, Facebook Prophet and other models were created, trying to make accurate stock predictions using historical data CSE All-Share (CSE) index. The past 4 years of data was used for more detailed and versatile output. Several market anomalies that would drive market sentiment were also looked into and the anomalies that created the most returns were identified. 

Different strategies that would influence stock fluctuations were analysed as well, using the Quantpedia website to see the individual days that stocks should be bought, sold or held. Some Sri-Lankan firm indexes such as Dialog Axiata Plc (DIAL) and Softlogic Life Insurance PLC (SFTL) had their moving averages and their best parameters identified.

All the models were created using the Python Programming Language and comments were made in the necessary places for ease of understanding.
